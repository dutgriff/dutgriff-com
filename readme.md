## DutGRIFF.com

DutGRIFF.com is my personal site. It is basically a place for me the trow stuff I don't know where to put. Some day it
will offer features to clients, show off some stuff that I have built and give me a place to blog. There is no set
direction for this project. Ideas and objectives will most likely change frequently.

This repo contains only the core of DutGRIFF.com. Many subdomain will not be included in this repo.
Although some subdomain will be added to github.com/dutgriff, many will be kept private.

If you are searching for the source for one of the subdomain or have any questions feel free to email me at 
[sites@dutgriff.com](mailto:sites@dutgriff.com).
