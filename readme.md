## DutGRIFF.com

DutGRIFF.com is my personal site dedicated to making things easier for my clients while allowing them so see something I
have built. There is no set direction for this project. Ideas and objectives will come and go.

This repo contains only the core for DutGRIFF.com. Many subdomain will not be included in this repo.
Although some subdomain will be added to github.com/dutgriff, many will be kept private.

If you are searching for the source for one of the subdomain or have any questions feel free to email me at
