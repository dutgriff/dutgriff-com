          Thanks for registering! Unfortunately there isn't a whole lot going on here yet. I do have some things in the
          works. Once I get around to creating a blog and a few more apps there may be some fun to have.

          One thing you can do now is create punches in the <a href="/timepunch">Time Punch demo</a>. Check out some of
          the code there. VueJS is a lot of fun. Also, if you are interested, you can see how the API works that Vue is
          calling by digging into the code over at <a href="//github.com/dutgriff/dutgriff-com">the GitHub repo</a>. Let
          me know what you think!
